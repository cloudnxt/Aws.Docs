# AWS Regions

• AWS has Regions all around the world&#x20;

• Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3…&#x20;

• A region is a cluster of data centers&#x20;

• <mark style="color:yellow;">Most AWS services are region-scoped</mark>



## How to choose an AWS Region?

* **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements**: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
* **Proximity to customers**: reduced latency&#x20;
* **Available services within a Region**: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region.&#x20;
* **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
