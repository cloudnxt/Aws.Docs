# AWS Availability Zones

* <mark style="color:green;">Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)</mark>. Example:&#x20;

&#x20;        • ap-southeast-2a&#x20;

&#x20;        • ap-southeast-2b&#x20;

&#x20;        • ap-southeast-2c&#x20;

* Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.&#x20;
* They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters.&#x20;
* They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
