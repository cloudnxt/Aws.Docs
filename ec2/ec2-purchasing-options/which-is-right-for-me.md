# Which is right for me?

* **On demand**: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
* **Reserved**: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.&#x20;
* **Savings Plans**: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, …)&#x20;
* **Spot instances**: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time.&#x20;
* **Dedicated Hosts**: We book an entire building of the resort.&#x20;
* **Capacity Reservations**: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it.
