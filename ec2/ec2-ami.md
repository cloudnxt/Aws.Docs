# EC2 - AMI

* AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance.
  * You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring…
  * Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged.
* <mark style="color:green;">AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)</mark>
* You can launch EC2 instances from:
  * A Public AMI: AWS provided
  * Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
  * An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
