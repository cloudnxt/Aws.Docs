## Why use a load balancer?

* Spread load across multiple downstream instances.&#x20;
* Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application.&#x20;
* Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances.
* Do regular health checks to your instances.&#x20;
* Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites.&#x20;
* Enforce stickiness with cookies&#x20;
* High availability across zones â€¢ Separate public traffic from private traffi
