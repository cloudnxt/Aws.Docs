# ELB - Sticky Sessions

* It is possible to implement stickiness so that the <mark style="color:green;">**same client is always redirected to the same instance**</mark> behind a load balancer.&#x20;
* This <mark style="color:green;">**works for Classic Load Balancers & Application Load Balancers**</mark>&#x20;
* The “<mark style="color:green;">**cookie**</mark>” used for stickiness has an expiration date you control.&#x20;
* Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his session data.&#x20;
* Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the load over the backend EC2 instances.
* <mark style="color:green;">**Application-based Cookies**</mark>** **&#x20;
  * **Custom cookie**&#x20;
    * Generated by the target&#x20;
    * Can include any custom attributes required by the application&#x20;
    * Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group&#x20;
    * Don’t use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)&#x20;
  * **Application cookie**&#x20;
    * Generated by the load balancer&#x20;
    * Cookie name is AWSALBAPP&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">**Duration-based Cookies**</mark>&#x20;
  * Cookie generated by the load balancer&#x20;
  * Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
