# EC2 - Instance Connect

* Connect to your EC2 instance within your browser.&#x20;
* No need to use your key file that was downloaded.&#x20;
* The “magic” is that a temporary key is uploaded onto EC2 by AWS&#x20;
* Works only out-of-the-box with Amazon Linux 2&#x20;
* Need to make sure the port 22 is still opened!
