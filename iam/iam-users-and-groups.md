# IAM: Users & Groups

* IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service&#x20;
* Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared.&#x20;
* Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.&#x20;
* Groups only contain users, not other groups.&#x20;
* Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.
